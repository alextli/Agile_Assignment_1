This article is interesting because it speaks about the coding interview from the perspective of an interviewer. I think it's
also important that Ish Baid, the author, emphasized the importance of "figuring it out" during the interview, because the
interviewer is attempting to assess your problem solving ability. Merely reciting a solution from Cracking the Coding Interview
is not helpful to either party.
