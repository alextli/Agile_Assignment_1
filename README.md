This article is interesting because it speaks about the coding interview from the perspective of an interviewer. I think it's
also important that Ish Baid, the author, emphasized the importance of "figuring it out" during the interview, because the
interviewer is attempting to assess your problem solving ability. Merely reciting a solution from Cracking the Coding Interview
is not helpful to either party.

*Chris's comment:*

I also think that this article can be extremely useful, because it is written from the perspective of an **interviewer**.  Additionally, he outlines step by step how a candidate should approach the problem, what types of problems are asked, and even what a candidate can do if they completely **have no idea what to do**. However, I do wish that the article included resources that are extremely helpful for candidates to better their coding skills such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com), and Cracking the Coding interview is still one of the best interview prep books out there.
